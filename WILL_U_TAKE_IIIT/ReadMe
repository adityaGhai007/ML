WILL YOU JOIN IIITDMJ?

This is the question we will try to answer today! I , with Shreyans Katariya have build this basic project. We started with a few basic questions which tried to bring out the sentiments of a student who looks for a college. This Research Survey was done through Google Form https://forms.gle/yKgfsfgs3EQuAY4T7

The questions were carefully curated as we wanted to find the true sentiments of a student looking for a college. The most important things a student looks for in a college are definetely

Placements

College Life & Culture

Ambience

These were taken care of. This was then formed into a CSV file which was the dataset of our project. Due to lack of available data (only 42 responses were done) the predictor performs okayish. Such data is important for the College Administration. These questions help to make startegies and roadmaps for the future of a particular college to attain the brightest minds.

From this we build the dataset provided and build this model.
