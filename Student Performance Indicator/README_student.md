STUDENT PERFORMANCE INDICATOR


The project aims to analyze the academic performance of students and investigate the potential relationship between various factors, including parental background, gender, race, and their impact on students' performance in exams. 

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project delves into the dataset to uncover meaningful insights and correlations that shed light on how these factors influence student achievement.

The findings from this analysis can provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and parents in understanding the dynamics of academic performance and help inform strategies to support student success.

I have done EDA in the following order.
